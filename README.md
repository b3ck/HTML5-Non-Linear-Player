HTML5-Non-Linear-Player
=======================

A random/non-linear browser based video player built in HTML5
by Ben Moren for MCAD Media2 Classes

Simply load up as many MP4 clips into the 'data' folder as you would like and change the 'num' variable to reflect the amount of videos present.

Roadmap:
  1. Eliminate the 'black flicker' in between each cut
  2. Add in some modes IE: full random, non-repeating random, linear
  3. Fix the full screen CSS to be more accurate
