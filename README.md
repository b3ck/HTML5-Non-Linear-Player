###HTML5-Non-Linear-Player

A random/non-linear browser based video player built in HTML5
by Ben Moren for MCAD Media2 Classes

####Usage:
Simply load up as many MP4 clips into the 'data' folder as you would like and change the 'num' variable to reflect the amount of videos present.

See comments in index.html for further explination of how things are working.

####Roadmap:
1. Eliminate the 'black flicker' in between each cut
2. Add in some modes IE: full random, non-repeating random, linear
3. Fix the full screen CSS to be more accurate
4. fully replicate the original Max/Msp version

####There are 3 files in here
+ the main basic example 
    + index.html
+ the more complex example showing some added functionality
    + added_complexity.html
+  a version working toward removing the black flicker by switching 2 seperate 'screens' infront of eachother - eventually will become a replicated version of the original max build.
    + full_version_max_rep.html
